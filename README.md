üìù **Automated CBC(KE) Learner Report Generator**

A robust and highly efficient solution for generating personalized Learner Report Forms by automating the grading and data consolidation process within Microsoft Excel and finalizing the reports in Microsoft Word.
This utility dramatically cuts down the manual effort required for generating large batches of individualized reports, ensuring consistency and accuracy across all documents/report forms for all learners. It‚Äôs useful especially in small schools without the financial muscle to acquire advanced tools like Zeraki Analytics software.

üåü **Features**

‚Ä¢	Automated Grading: Instantly converts numerical scores into competency levels (e.g., Exceeding Expectations, Meeting Expectations) using defined grade boundaries.
‚Ä¢	Data Consolidation: Merges raw scores, competency grades (for the new Competency Based Curriculum in Kenya), and personalized remarks into a single, comprehensive data sheet.
‚Ä¢	Template-Driven Output: Utilizes Microsoft Word's powerful Mail Merge feature for quick generation of professional, standardized report forms.
‚Ä¢	Custom Comments: Facilitates the inclusion of personalized subject comments and general performance remarks.

‚öôÔ∏è** Core Components**

This project is built primarily using the powerful calculation and data processing capabilities of Microsoft Excel and the document generation features of Microsoft Word.
Key Excel Functions Used
The automated processing within the Excel spreadsheet relies on the following essential functions to transform raw data into report-ready information:
‚Ä¢	IFS Function: Crucial for assigning the required competency levels (e.g., ME2, EE1) by checking if a student's score meets multiple specified conditions/boundaries.
‚Ä¢	SUM Function: Used to efficiently calculate total marks across all subjects for each student.
‚Ä¢	VLOOKUP or XLOOKUP (depending on Excel version): Essential for quickly fetching or cross-referencing data, such as pulling personalized comments or teacher names from a separate reference tab into the main data sheet.
‚Ä¢	CONCATENATE or & operator: Used to join data fields (e.g., student name, performance level, and a generic phrase) to create semi-automated, dynamic comments.

üöÄ **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to set up and run the report generation process on your local machine.
Prerequisites
You need access to the following software:
‚Ä¢	Microsoft Excel (2019 or newer is recommended for the IFS function)
‚Ä¢	Microsoft Word
Installation and Setup
1.	Clone the repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/nobeardguy/ StudentAutomaticReportGeneration.git
2.	Prepare Files:
 a)	Ensure your raw data is correctly formatted in the input sheet (e.g., mirroring GRADE 7 END TERM3.xlsx - Sheet1.csv structure).
b)	The processed output sheet (e.g., GRADE 7 END TERM3.xlsx - GRADE7_ENDTERM3_REPORT_GEN.csv in its original Excel format) must be generated by running the formulas. This sheet will be your Mail Merge source.

üõ† **Usage**
The report generation is a two-step process: Data Processing (Excel) and Document Merging (Word).
Step 1: Data Processing (In Excel)
1.	Open the main Excel workbook.
2.	Verify that all IFS and VLOOKUP formulas are correctly applied to the raw scores sheet to populate the processed data sheet (the one containing competency levels, total marks, and comments).
3.	Save the processed data sheet as the final, clean source file for the report merge.
Step 2: Report Generation (In Word)
1.	Open the Word Report Template (the .docx file).
2.	Navigate to the Mailings tab in Word.
3.	Select Start Mail Merge and then Select Recipients.
4.	Choose the processed data file from Step 1 (e.g., the CSV or Excel file containing all the competency and comment columns).
5.	Match the fields in the Word template (e.g., <<NAME>>, <<ENG_LEVEL>>, <<TOTAL>>) to the column headers in your data source.
6.	Select Finish & Merge to generate all the individualized report documents.
